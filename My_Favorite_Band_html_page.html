        <h2>A Little Bit About The Doors</h2>
        <p>The Doors were formed in 1965 in Los Angeles. The band consisted of vocalist Jim Morrison, keyboardist Ray Manzarek, drummer John Densmore, and guitarist Robby Krieger. Notably, the band did not employ a bassist and instead played basslines on Ray Manzarek's Rhodes Piano. The Band was at the forefront of the counterculture movement and combined psychadelic rock with blues rock. Jim Morrison, notorious for his proclivity for drugs and general debauchery, became a household name and embodied the ethos of what many attribute to most rock stars: controversial, dissolute and debauched, fond of wearing leather pants, and tortured and surly. The band enjoyed great success until 1971 when Jim Morrison died at 27 in Paris, France due to an accidental heroin overdose. He was 27. The band continued on without Morrison for two years before disbanding in 1973.</p>
